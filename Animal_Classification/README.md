# Animal Classification: Cat and Dog Classification
## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying animalsâ€”specifically distinguishing between cats and dogs using image data. By leveraging the power of Deep Learning, the model learns to recognize visual patterns in images, enabling it to accurately classify new images of cats and dogs.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that can classify images as either a cat or a dog. CNNs are highly effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically capture spatial hierarchies in images.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled images of cats and dogs. These images were split into training, validation, and test sets to train the model and evaluate its performance.

### Dataset Structure:
Training set: Contains images of cats and dogs used to train the CNN.
Validation set: Used to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Test set: Used to assess the final accuracy and performance of the trained model.
