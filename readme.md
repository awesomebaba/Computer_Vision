This repository contains projects related to Computer Vision implemented using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques.

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a field of **artificial intelligence** that enables computers and systems to interpret and process visual information from the world, such as images and videos. It aims to automate tasks that require visual perception, such as object detection, image classification, and image segmentation. 

Computer Vision is closely linked to Machine Learning and Deep Learning, where ML provides algorithms to recognize patterns in data, and DL, through neural networks, enhances the ability to understand complex patterns in large image datasets.

## Project Overviews
1. **Animal Classification:** Cat and Dog Classification
This project focuses on distinguishing between two animal species, cats and dogs, using a dataset of labeled images. A deep learning model, typically a convolutional neural network (CNN), was trained to classify images into either category. This project demonstrates the application of DL in image classification tasks.

2. **Medicine Classification:** Ayurvedic Medicine Classification
The goal of this project was to classify various Ayurvedic medicines based on images of plants and herbs. The dataset includes categorized images of different Ayurvedic plants, and a machine learning model was trained to identify the correct category of medicine based on the plant image. This project is useful for automating the identification of medicinal plants in the Ayurvedic field.

3. **Potato Classification:** Potato Blight Disease Classification
This project addresses the classification of potato diseases, specifically potato blight, using images of potato leaves. A deep learning model was trained to detect whether a potato plant is affected by blight or healthy. The model assists in early detection of crop diseases, which is crucial for agricultural management.
